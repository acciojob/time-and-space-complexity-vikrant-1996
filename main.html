    <h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to execute as a function of its input size. It is an essential factor in determining the performance and scalability of a program, as efficient algorithms can lead to slow execution times and unresponsive applications.2</p>
	<p>O(n) – linear complexity – takes space directly proportional to the input size. O(n log n) – log-linear/quasilinear complexity – also called “linearithmic”, its <b>Space Complexity</b> grows proportionally to the input size and a logarithmic factor.</p>
